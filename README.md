- `models/movie.py`
- `models/genres.py`

## class diagram (so far ðŸ™ˆ)
![current class diagram](assets/movie-theater-cli_class-diagram.jpg?raw=true "Class diagram").

## what to do next?
You may use this repo to read and understand python code, consider class diagram to python class code translation, as well as checking differences between functional programming paradigm and object oriented paradigm approaches. ðŸ¤“

You may also try to implement the rest of classes adding methods you consider necessary in order to complete missing features, as well as needed json files in order to save data.

If you deploy any feature and would like to push it to this repo, fork it and send your pull request to check it out and merge it! ðŸ˜Ž

### missing features:
- schedule movies on screens (expecting to use static time blocks, as 1pm, 4pm, 7pm, 10pm for each screen; schedule is always today's schedule...)
- sell a ticket to a customer to watch a specific movie on a specific time block at a specific screen
- view movie theater movie schedule
- delete a movie (also deletes movie_genres...)
- delete a schedule object (a movie on a screen at a time block)
